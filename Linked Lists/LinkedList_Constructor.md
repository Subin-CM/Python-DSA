# LinkedList Constructor

Using this constructor we're good to create a new LinkedList from scratch. For that we need to create two classes *Node* and *LinkedList*

1. Class *Node*:

Using this we can set Value and initalize Next reference for the LinkedList.

2. Class *LinkedList* :

A constructor that takes a value as an argument, creates a new Node with that value, and initializes the head and tail attributes of the linked list to point to the new node.

A length attribute, initialized to 1, which represents the current number of nodes in the list.
